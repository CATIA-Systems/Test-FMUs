# Test FMUs

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/CATIA-Systems/Test-FMUs/_apis/build/status/CATIA-Systems.Test-FMUs?branchName=develop)](https://dev.azure.com/CATIA-Systems/Test-FMUs/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=develop)

A set of test models for development, testing and debugging of the [Functional Mock-up Interface](https://fmi-standard.org/).

- [BouncingBall](BouncingBall) - a bouncing ball model with state events
- [Dahlquist](Dahlquist) - Dahlquist test equation
- [Feedthrough](Feedthrough) - all variable types
- [Resource](Resource) - load data from a file
- [Stair](Stair) - a counter with time events
- [VanDerPol](VanDerPol) - Van der Pol test equation

## Repository structure

`<model>`
- `config.h` - model specific types and definitions
- `FMI{1CS|1ME|2|3}.xml` - model descriptions
- `model.c` - implementation of the model

`include`
- `fmi{|2|3}Functions.h` - FMI header files
- `model.h` - generic model interface
- `slave.h` - generic co-simulation interface

`src`
- `fmi{1|2|3}Functions.c` - FMI implementations
- `slave.c` - generic co-simulation

## Build the FMUs

To build the FMUs you need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and a supported [build tool](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) e.g. Visual Studio, Xcode or make:

- download or clone the repository

- open the [CMakeGUI](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/)

- click `Browse Source...` and select the cloned or downloaded and extracted repository (that contains `CMakeLists.txt`)

- click `Browse Build...` and select the folder where you want build the FMUs

- click `Configure` and select the generator for your IDE / build tool

- select the `FMI_VERSION` you want to build and optionally the `FMI_TYPE` (only for FMI 1.0)

- click `Generate` to generate the project files

- click `Open Project` or open the project in your build tool

- build the project

The FMUs will be in the `dist` folder inside the selected build folder.
